to the minimum queue currently in progress. Counter users can close the counter for no
more client issues.

Normal users can add issues for the queue. If an ongoing issue is
available, the user can’t create another issue. He/She can view the ongoing number for
the he/she assigned queue. He/She can cancel the ongoing.
